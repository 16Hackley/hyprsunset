## hyprsunset
An application to enable a blue-light filter on Hyprland

> !IMPORTANT!
> This application relies on https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/pull/8023
> which is only available in hyprland-git right now!

## Usage

See `hyprsunset --help`.

## Support

This utility relies on support for `hyprland-ctm-control-v1` by the compositor, so
it's most likely hyprland-exclusive.
