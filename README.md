## hyprsunset
An application to enable a blue-light filter on Hyprland

> !IMPORTANT!
> This application relies on functionality that isn't yet merged in main Hyprland! 
> see https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/pull/8023

## Usage

See `hyprsunset --help`.

## Support

This utility relies on support for `hyprland-ctm-control-v1` by the compositor, so
it's most likely hyprland-exclusive.
